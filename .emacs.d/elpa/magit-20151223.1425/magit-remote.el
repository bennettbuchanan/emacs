(magit-define-popup magit-pull-and-fetch-popup
  "Popup console for pull and fetch commands.

This popup is intended as a replacement for the separate popups
`magit-pull-popup' and `magit-fetch-popup'.  To use it, add this
to your init file:

  (with-eval-after-load \\='magit-remote
    (define-key magit-mode-map \"f\" \\='magit-pull-and-fetch-popup)
    (define-key magit-mode-map \"F\" nil))

The combined popup does not offer all commands and arguments
available from the individual popups.  Instead of the argument
`--prune' and the command `magit-fetch-all' it uses two commands
`magit-fetch-prune' and `magit-fetch-no-prune'.  And the commands
`magit-fetch-from-pushremote' and `magit-fetch-from-upstream' are
missing.  To add them use something like:

  (with-eval-after-load \\='magit-remote
    (magit-define-popup-action \\='magit-pull-and-fetch-popup ?U
      \\='magit-get-upstream-branch
      \\='magit-fetch-from-upstream-remote ?F)

if the push-remote resp. upstream is not configured.  If the user
invokes one of these commands anyway, then it raises an error.

When non-nil, then these commands always appear in the push
popup.  But if the required configuration is missing, then they
do appear in a way that indicates that this is the case.  If the
user invokes one of them, then it asks for the necessary
configuration, stores the configuration, and then uses it to push
a first time.

This option also affects whether the argument `--set-upstream' is
available in the popup.  If the value is t, then that argument is
redundant.  But note that changing the value of this option does
not take affect immediately, the argument will only be added or
removed after restarting Emacs."
